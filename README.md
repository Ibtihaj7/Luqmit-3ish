<h1> Luqmit 3ish </h1>
In this project, we created a way of networking between restaurants and charities to manage daily food surplus from restaurants in beneficial ways
rather than throwing it away.

<br>
<br>
<ul>problem statement:</ul>
<li>The inability of associations to provide sufficient quantities of food to distribute to those in need.
</li>
<li>Excess daily food waste by restaurants and their disposal, which leads to environmental damage, pollution, and others.
</li>
<li>Difficulty communicating associations with restaurants and knowledge of the daily surplus food in restaurants.
</li>
<br>
<br>
<ul>solutions: </ul>
<li>We will create a website that facilitates the communication of the charities with restaurants and facilitates the process of reserve a donation.
  </li>
  
  <li>The website will contain a page for restaurants and another one for charities.
  </li>
   <li>Restaurants and charities will be able to create their own profile page.
  </li>
     <li>Restaurants will be able to determine the type of daily meals that they can donate, with specifying quantities and a description of the meal.
  </li>
  <li>Restaurants will be able to see all their reservations, and they can can cancel them upon receipt from the charities headquarters.
</li>
<li>Charities will be able to see all restaurants that have an account on the site.
</li>
<li>Charities will be able to reserve the available restaurantâ€™s meals, specifying the desired quantities and  confirming the reservation.
